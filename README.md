Code base to provide a test bench for different traffic control algorithms.
The code allows for creation of user provided number of junctions and capability of throwing in custom randomized vehicles .
The algorithms for operation of traffic lights can be set , aimed at backpressure algorithm . it does not allow for interaction between nodes.
Requirements Traci and SUMO.
To run the simulation, make sure you have SUMO installed and SUMO_HOME enviornment variable set to have your sumo installation directory
Go to scripts and run the traciinterface.py file to start the simulation
