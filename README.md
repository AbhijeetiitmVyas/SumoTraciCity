# SumoTraciCity
Code base to provide a test bench for different traffic control algorithms.
The code allows for creation of user provided number of junctions and capability of throwing in custom randomized vehicles .
The algorithms for operation of traffic lights can be set , aimed at backpressure algorithm . it does not allow for interaction between nodes.
